Dockerfile+image
- Singularity image for HPC

Pipeline (volunteer)
- if R1 or R2 are excluded, then ensure these are not zipped as is the casefor D rerio.
- if R1 or R2 are too short, then exclude. Dont let skewer omit the read pair.
- more sanitation prior to upload at least check TSVs are present and fastq/sra are gone

Uploads
- Allow more elegant dataset sanitation and transfer to backend
  - dont allow new uploads to fill the disk
  - if backend server is not available, then don't transfer or delete zip archive

FrontEnd
- Make zip archives and matrices available
