# Backend scripts
The backend scripts are found here. These are used to collect incoming dataset and filter them based on several quality 
measures. The R script "dee_pipeline.R" is the master script that coordinates most of the work. Functions are kept in a separate file. The shell script does some of the computationally intensive work that would take too long in R.
